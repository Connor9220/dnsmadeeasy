See http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/enterprisedns/api.html for API documentation. Please note this ruby script is based off the sample perl script provided by DNS Made Easy

Config File: a file named dnsmeapi.properties must exist in your current directory, with the following contents:
apiKey=ReplaceWithYourAPIKey
secretKey=ReplaceWithYourSecretKey

Usage Examples:

Get a list of domains: dnsmeapi.rb http://api.dnsmadeeasy.com/V1.2/domains --header accept:application/json|prettify_json.rb 
Get a list of records in a single zone: dnsmeapi.rb http://api.dnsmadeeasy.com/V1.2/domains/yourdomain.com/records --header accept:application/json|prettify_json.rb

Please note the output JSON is dense. If you would like to make it easier to read you can pipe the output to one of the following tools:
| prettify_json.rb # comes with the json ruby gem ("gem install json")
| python -mjson.tool # comes standard with Python 2.6+
| jazor # A simple commandline JSON parsing tool written in Ruby ("gem install jazor" to install)
